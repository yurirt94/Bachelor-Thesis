1 - Crash do tkinter quando usa barra de rolagem


I have a GUI that crashes when I use the my scroll bar, which appears to be this error: http://bugs.python.org/issue10731

It seems that the problem has been fixed for newer versions of tkinter.

When I write conda list, the list shows tk version 8.5.18

However, when I write in my code print(Tk().eval('info patchlevel')), it prints version 8.5.9

I believe this means my interpreter is not using the newer version 8.5.18. I couldn't find a way to change it to this newer one. How can I achieve this?
